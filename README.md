Milton Academy Information App

The purpose of this app is to give students what they want: the ability to know which lunch line to get in without having to waste those ten extra steps walking there and back. Efficiency.

Also, SAA stuff. 

In the immortal words of Jay-Z: "Whatever deity may guide my life, dear lord don't let me die tonight. But if I shall before I wake, I'd accept my fate."

Been known to happen while programming. Code can kill you!
